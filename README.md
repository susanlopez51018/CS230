Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?  The Gaming Room is a client that wanted to expand their existing game, "Draw It or Lose It", beyond it's initial Android release to support multiple platforms including Windows, macOS, Linux, and web-based environments.  Their primary requirements included a scalable, cloud-hosted solution capable of supporting thousands of simultaneous gamers. They needed efficient memory and storage management to handle a large amount of images and real-time interactions.  Smooth gameplay across the platform was needed to ensure a seemless user experience with robust security measures.
