>Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?  

The Gaming Room is a client that wanted to expand their existing game, "Draw It or Lose It", beyond it's initial Android release to support multiple platforms including Windows, macOS, Linux, and web-based environments.  Their primary requirements included a scalable, cloud-hosted solution capable of supporting thousands of simultaneous gamers. They needed efficient memory and storage management to handle a large amount of images and real-time interactions.  Smooth gameplay across the platform was needed to ensure a seemless user experience with robust security measures.  

>What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

A strength in mhy document was being able to outline and explain how cloud-based solutions could optimize scalability, security, and performance.  I attempted to outline key system components in a well-defined manner focusing on storage and memory management.  

>What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Using the design documentation is extremely helpful to have a solid understanding of the scope of the project and what will potentially be required.  This will help with directing work, efficiency, and controlling costs that may come from having to re-work efforts due to unplanned for setbacks.  Potential challenges or conflicts in deisgn can be identified earlier.  Since we are also using microservices, this helps with software structure and documentation.  

>If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I think I probably could have talked more about kernel-level optimizations and who game-performance can be affected.  I feel like I didn't really tackle this at all.  I could have probably gone more in-depth on each different OS and how they can affect real-time gaming.  

I tried to prioritize the user's needs by addresssing low lag times and optmizing real-time updates.  I also wanted to make ensure high performance across multiple platforms.  This will help with user experience.  If the user doesn't have a good experience success of the game will be poor.  Additionally, I wanted to also the game was secure and data breaches could be minimized for safety but also to reduce liability.  

>How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I can see the importance of analysis for any project regarding client / user needs, security, infrastructure, and best practices.  In a future project, I would likely implement more iterative testing, more automation, and more documentation.
